# Monte-Carlo-Simulation-for-COVID-incentives
This is a project for STMATH 381 Discreet Mathematical Modeling
Students are required to get COVID-19 vaccines before returning
to campus. Vaccine A, vaccine B, vaccine C are available. Vaccine A requires two shots
(second shot must be vaccine A) whereas vaccine B and C needs one. The State has incentives to
encourage residents to get COVID vaccine. Incentive 1 gives people who get the vaccine three
lottery tickets of Game 1. Game 1 has 10% to win 100 dollars. ⅓ of people who get the vaccine
gets incentive 1. Incentive 2 gives people who get the vaccine three lottery tickets of Game 2. ⅓
of people who get the vaccine gets incentive 2. Game 2 has 5% to win 200 dollars. Incentive 3
gives every 300 people who get the vaccine a paid trip to Hawaii plus 300 dollars cash. People
are eligible for incentives each time they get a vaccine shot. 500 UW students plan to get
vaccines in order to return campus in fall. Each student has equal probability of getting either
vaccine. Maximum number of vaccine shots a student can have is two. On average, how much
money can a student make when all 500 students get the vaccine?
